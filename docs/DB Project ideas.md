# Views Usages



### ðŸ”¹ 1. Active Infections by Area

A view to check which areas currently have ongoing infections.

```sql
CREATE VIEW ActiveInfectionsByArea AS
SELECT a.AreaID, a.Name AS AreaName, COUNT(*) AS ActiveCases
FROM Infection i
JOIN Patient p ON i.PatientID = p.PatientID
JOIN Area a ON p.AreaID = a.AreaID
WHERE i.Status = 'Active'
GROUP BY a.AreaID, a.Name;
```

ðŸ‘‰ Useful for **monitoring outbreaks** geographically.

### ðŸ”¹ 2. Vaccination Status of Patients

A view to know which patients are fully/partially vaccinated based on required doses.

```sql
CREATE VIEW VaccinationStatus AS
SELECT p.PatientID, p.Name,
       v.Name AS VaccineName,
       COUNT(vr.DoseNo) AS DosesTaken,
       v.DoseCount AS TotalDoses,
       CASE WHEN COUNT(vr.DoseNo) = v.DoseCount THEN 'Fully Vaccinated'
            ELSE 'Partially Vaccinated' END AS Status
FROM Patient p
JOIN VaccinationRecord vr ON p.PatientID = vr.PatientID
JOIN VaccineBatch vb ON vr.BatchID = vb.BatchID
JOIN Vaccine v ON vb.VaccineID = v.VaccineID
GROUP BY p.PatientID, p.Name, v.Name, v.DoseCount;
```

ðŸ‘‰ Can be used for **reports** or patient dashboards.

### ðŸ”¹ 3. High-Risk Contacts

A view to identify patients who had contact with others in high-risk areas.

```sql
CREATE VIEW HighRiskContacts AS
SELECT c.PatientID, p.Name AS PatientName,
       c.ContactPersonID, c.Date, a.Name AS AreaName, a.RiskLevel
FROM Contacts c
JOIN Area a ON c.AreaID = a.AreaID
JOIN Patient p ON c.PatientID = p.PatientID
WHERE a.RiskLevel = 'High';
```

ðŸ‘‰ Helps with **contact tracing**.
